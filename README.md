# Data Analysis of Global Terrorism Database

## Motivation
In recent years, Global Terrorism has become a serious National and International issue as the world continues to be plagued by rampant terrorist attacks despite international efforts to prevent such attacks. It has disrupted our way of life more than we could have imagined. This project aims to conduct Data Exploration on the Global Terrorism Dataset in hopes of discovering insights behind terrorist attacks. 

## Objective

* Text/Sentiment Analysis of Reports On Terrorist Attacks - WordCloud
* Identify Which Feature Is More Important In Contributing To The Success of A Terrorist Attack
* Determine Whether Terrorist Attacks Are More Concentrated In Certain Regions (column K - region_txt)/countries (column I - country_txt)
* Determine Whether There Is A Prevalent Attack Type (column AD - AH)

## Things To Note

The complete dataset could be downloaded from Kaggle. I've done some Datacleaning and removed unneccessary columns and focused on 2000-2017 before embarking on this project as the dataset is huge.
